This Flask application provides simple access to the logs produced
by [Bernard J. Ortcutt](https://github.com/leviroth/bernard). At this time,
configuration is only documented implicitly via `sample_config.py`. Fill in the
relevant details and rename to `config.py`, and you should be most of the way to
a running app. Oh, and you'll need a local [redis](https://redis.io/) instance,
which you'll want to [secure](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart#securing-redis).
